    "#### What is Computational Thinking?\n",
    "Computational thinking is a way of solving problems and designing systems that draws on concepts fundamental to computer science. To flourish in today's world, computational thinking has to be a fundamental part of the way people think and understand the world. Through this course you may be experiencing computation thinking for the first time.  At times this process will be very frustrating when you get to this point you need to find some help by asking me questions.</P>\n",
    "#### What is Computational Physics?\n",
    "Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. </P>\n",
    "<img src=\"Computational_physics_diagram.png\">\n",
    "What this means is you will be learning a programming language called Python to help solve problems in this class.  Each unit will have a set of problems based on the unit material that you will need to solve by writing code.</P>\n",
    "### Computational Physics a simple example:\n",
    "Lets start with a simple example from Science 10:\n",
    "A car is travelling at a velocity of 33.33 m/s for 22.21 s how far will the car travel in this time?\n",
    "The information we have is: v = 33.33 metres/second, t = 22.21 seconds and we need to find distance d = ?\n",
    "In Science 10 your teacher should have told you that the velocity of an object is found by dividing the distance the object travels by the amount of time it took to cover the distance or </P>\n",
    "$$v = {d} / {t}$$\n",
    "So if we want to find the distance travelled in the time give that would be </P>\n",
    "$$d = {v} * {t}$$\n",
    "Let us write that need code.  Here are the step we can use:\n",
    "1. Our first step is to set the variables\n",
    "2. Entre the equation using our variables\n",
    "3. Ask the computer to print the answer</P>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b>-We will not be using units at first, we will look at there use later.</P>\n",

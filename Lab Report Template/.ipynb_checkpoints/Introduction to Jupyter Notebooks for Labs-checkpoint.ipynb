    "##  Hypothesis:\n",
    "Hightlight the text in this cell of the template and replace them with what you think is going to be the result of the lab. Don't forget a hypothesis is a tentative, testable answer to a scientific question. Once a scientist has a scientific question she is interested in, the scientist reads up to find out what is already known on the topic. Then she uses that information to form a tentative answer to her scientific question. Sometimes people refer to the tentative answer as \"an educated guess.\" Keep in mind, though, that the hypothesis also has to be testable since the next step is to do an experiment to determine whether or not the hypothesis is right! \n",

    "##  Observations:\n",
    "Don't forget your job is to keep everything constant but what you are trying to measure, the stretch of the spring. Its your job to come up with a way of doing this with the minimum amount of possible error. Record you data in two 1D arrays. One for the Dependant variable and the other for the Independent variable. Don't forget to display the variables as ordered pairs, see Lesson 1 if you need a fresher."

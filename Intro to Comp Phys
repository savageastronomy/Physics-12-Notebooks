### Computational Science for Physics 12 Students

#### Introduction
Computational Science is now indispensable to the solution of complex problems in every sector, from traditional science and engineering domains to such key areas as national security, public health, and economic innovation. Advances in computing and connectivity make it possible to develop computational models and capture and analyze unprecedented amounts of experimental and observational data to address problems previously deemed intractable or beyond imagination. 

#### Why Python?
The Python programming language is an excellent choice for learning, teaching, or doing computational physics. It is a well-designed, modern programming language that is simultaneously easy to learn and very powerful. It includes a range of features tailored for scientific computing, including features for handling vectors, inverting and diagonalizing matrices, performing Fourier transforms, making graphs, and creating 3D graphics.

# Computational Physics
Welcome to my Github repository for Physics 12.
In the repository you will find several Jupyter Notebooks that I have written to support computational thinking 
in Physics 12.
If you think that these notebooks will be of use to you please feel free to use them. But please give credit where credit is due.

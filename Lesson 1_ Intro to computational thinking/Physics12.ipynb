    "## Introduction to Computational Thinking in Physics 12\n",
    "### What is Computational Thinking?\n",
    "Computational thinking is a way of solving problems and developing systems to solve problems that draws on concepts fundamental to computer science. It has become an integral part of our society and to flourish in today's world, computational thinking has to be a fundamental part of the way people think and solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been doing computational thinking everyday of your life from putting your clothes on in the morning to cooking an evening meal. In these two cases you have come up with a sequence of events that happen in a specific order. You wouldn't think of putting one pant leg on followed by one shirt arm and then the other pant leg. Early in your childhood you learned or figured out a system for getting dressed that is both effective and safe. That's computational thinking!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of this course the process may seem foreign but it is the way you have been solving your physics and math problems since grade school however, now you are going to use a computer and a computer language instead of paper and pen. At times the process maybe very frustrating, when you get to this point you need to find some help by asking me, a fellow student or checking a website called<a href=\\\" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python \"> Stack Over Flow </a>. Here you can search for the answer to the problem you are having, chances are you are not the first person to have a specific problem and your solution is only a mouse click away.</P>\n",
    "### What is Computational Physics?\n",
    "Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. The process for computational physics is the same for physics, you start with a hypothesis, collect some data, you then write a program that analyses the data to find a relationship and present the results.  The advantage of computational physics is that you can quickly analyse very large data sets, like what we find at <a href=\\\"https://home.cern/\\\">CERN</a> or <a href=\\\"https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/\\\">LIGO</a>, this can save time and money. Another advantage is that you can put your analysis on the Internet to let other scrutinize your data and methods, a very important part of science.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Computational_physics_diagram.png\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "What this means for you is that you will need to learn a programming language called Python to help you solve problems and analyse data. Each unit in the course will have a set of problems based on the concepts that you will need to solve by writing code in a Notebook, like this one. The Notebook will be graded and handed back to you so you can correct your mistakes and resubmit your work. It is important to learn from your mistakes it not only improves your mark, more importantly, it also improves your understanding of the course material.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our First  Example\n",
    "Let'Â’s start with a simple example from Science 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "A car is travelling at a velocity of 33.33 m/s for 22.21 s, how far will the car travel in this time?\n",
    "\n",
    "The information we have is: v = 33.33 metres/second, t = 22.21 seconds and we need to find distance d = ?.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Science 10 your teacher should have told you that the velocity of an object is found by dividing the distance the object travels by the amount of time it took to cover the distance or\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = {d} / {t}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "So if we want to find the distance travelled in the time give that would be\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d = {v} * {t}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let us write the need code.  Here are the step we can use:\n",
    "    1. Our first step is to set the variables.\n",
    "    2. Entre the equation using our variables.\n",
    "    3. Ask the computer to print the answer.\n",
    " <b> Note </b>-We will not be using units at first, we will look at there use later.\n",
